Redirecting degen yields for regen tokens

Building a protocol that aggregates the best yield farming strategies across EVM chains and redirects the gains from those strategies towards regen tokens ($EARTH)

Ex - Your yield from lending/borrowing protocols, LPs on dex, point farming vaults, airdrops will be automagically sold for stables which will be redirected to buying $EARTH to help you book profits for regeneration while also earning APYs from $EARTH

Expected Flow - 

1. User comes to our website, finds all the yield farming strategies across chains
2. Selects the strategy that aligns with their risk/reward
3. Gives permission to our smart contract to extract the yield from those strategies at regular intervals
4. That yield is redirected to our $EARTH/$DAI LP where the $DAI buys $EARTH
5. That $EARTH is then staked on the users behalf, giving them $FRUIT (our yield bearing token)
6. User can choose to unstake their $EARTH and get $DAI as and when they decide to
